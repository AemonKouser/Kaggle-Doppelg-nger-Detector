#  MetaKaggle DoppelgÃ¤nger Detector (Hackathon Submission)

This project uncovers lookalike Kaggle users based on contribution behavior, ranks, medals, competition scores, and kernel performance. Built for the **Meta Kaggle Hackathon**, it uses Python, pandas, cosine similarity, and visualizations to recommend the top most similar users â€” or "doppelgÃ¤ngers" â€” for any given user on Kaggle.

---

##  Goal

To analyze Kaggle user behavior and **find similar users** using engineered features and cosine similarity, creating a system that helps:

- New users discover role models to follow  
- Community builders connect like-minded contributors  
- Kaggle improve user engagement & personalization
